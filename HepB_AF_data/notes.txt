good visualisation of codon rarity difference pdb files:
spectrum b, blue_white_red, selection=ALL 

visualisation by codon rarity as done by Kate:
spectrum b, red_orange_yellow_white_green_cyan_blue_purple, minimum=0.05, maximum=0.12,
==> has the advantage of having one colour to accommodate per %
