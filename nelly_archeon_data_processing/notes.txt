* compareM.pbs - the bash script I used to run compareM
* compare_codon_usage_output.tsv – the output of running compareM on one genome
* multiMAG_compareM_output – the output of running compareM on multiple genomes
* manual_like4like_table.xlsx – my manual codon translation table
* manual_like4like_table.txt – the codon translation table that was used as input for the python script
* codon_replacement.py – the python script made to do the job

Here’s the github link for the softwares I used:
* Prodigal:  https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal - I used prodigal to generate a fasta file of the coding sequence (CDS) of a genome which was used as my input for CompareM. CompareM can also use Prodigal to do the same thing, I had just done it previously myself.
* CompareM: https://github.com/donovan-h-parks/CompareM/blob/master/users_guide.pdf
