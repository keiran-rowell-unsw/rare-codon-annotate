Description:
  This compressed file contains the contents of the Codon Statistics
Database. Each folder corresponds to one species. The name of each folder
corresponds to the Taxonomy ID of the species (e.g., data/9606 contains the
information for Homo sapiens).
  Each folder contains the following files:
- nuclear_codon_statistics.tsv: Contains codon statistics derived from
  analysis of all nuclear protein-coding genes. 
- nuclear_gene_statistics.tsv: Contains gene statistics derived from analysis
  of all nuclear protein-coding genes.
- ribosomal_codon_statistics.tsv: Contains codon statistics derived from
  analysis of all nuclear genes encoding ribosomal proteins. 
- ribosomal_gene_statistics.tsv: Contains gene statistics derived from
  analysis of all nuclear genes encoding ribosomal proteins.
- mitochondrial_codon_statistics.tsv: Contains codon statistics derived from
  analysis of all mitochondrial genes. This file is only available for
  eukaryotic species with mitochondrial genes available in the relevant
  assembly.
- mitochondrial_gene_statistics.tsv: Contains gene statistics derived from
  analysis of all mitochondrial genes. This file is only available for
  eukaryotic species with mitochondrial genes available in the relevant
  assembly.
- plastid_codon_statistics.tsv: Contains codon statistics derived from
  analysis of all chloroplast genes. This file is only available for plant
  species with chloroplast genes available in the relevant assembly.
- plastid_gene_statistics.tsv: Contains gene statistics derived from analysis
  of all chloroplast genes. This file is only available for plant species
  with chloroplast genes available in the relevant assembly.
