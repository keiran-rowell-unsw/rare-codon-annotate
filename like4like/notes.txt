There are several codon tables now, including:
- python_codon_tables package: https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/codon-usage-tables, which uses:
    - http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/ (derived from NCBI-GenBack Release 160.0 [2007])
- Codon Statistics Database: http://codonstatsdb.unr.edu/
    - From 2022, every species in RefSeq. Paper: https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac157       
   
Can download the whole flat database (6 GB) codonstatsdb.unr.edu/codonstatsdb_MONTHYEAR.tar.gz. Then run gen_tables_from_codonstatsdb.py to turn into nested dicts a la python_codon_tables 

Prep before running gen_tables_from_codonstatsdb is as follows: 
    - wget codon stats files from codonstatsdb.unr.edu/codonstatsdb_MONTHYEAR.tar.gz Manually at the moment since updates aren't frequent
    - extract the .tar.gz file
    - delete .RData and .Rhistory
    - delete the gene, ribosomal, plastid, and mitochrondrial, bottom decile, .tsvs
    - remove the 7 heading lines before tsv data on all files ---- tail -n +9 file.tsv > file.tsv
    - remove double entry (two tables) from taxIDs 11269, 157592, 129875, 11082, 1476464, 562, 64320
    - remove NA codons from taxIDs 129875, 108098, 10665
    - delete taxID directory 592361 entirely, the formatting of the statistical table is corrupted and I don't want to make a judgement call
    - rmdir any empty directories if there are any just to make sure

#Next to start look at like4like in evolutionary conserved proteins

#Stick with just looking at E. Coli for condon tables and rare codon usage  

#Next :
rare_codon.py
- paste in RNA
- use E. Coli codon table
- pull PDB and EBI structures
- replace the B-factor with the rarity 


## Look at EBI database PDBs -- the format is always the same there from EBI AlphaFold -- biggest usecase


## Issues:
    - Why are some TER '*' stop codons listed as 0.0 in fraction
